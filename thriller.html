		<h1>Thriller</h1>
		<h2>As told by Pop Sonnets</h2>

		<p>A terror strikes thee at the witching hour
		when moonlight's flow reveals the horrid shape.
		The dread, it strikes with petrifying pow'r: 
		thy screams are mute, thy mouth is left agape. 
		The door slams shut - the monster's coming near - 
		thine eyes find no escape, to thy dismay - 
		and so they close in agony and fear
		now as the creature closes on its prey. 
		There is no one to save thee from thy fate;
		no hero shall this villain fierce assail - 
		when suddenly, the onslaught doth abate,
		for thou art roused from this fantastic tale.
		-- 	I'll thee protect from all the story's ghosts,
		for I'm the one who'll thrill thy soul the most.</p>
